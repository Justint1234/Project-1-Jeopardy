# Project-1-Jeopardy

For Project 1 I created a geek related Jeopardy game pertaining to comics and anime. Basically everything a geek would be interested in. This game involves questions relating comic book movies, video games, super powers, heroes, and anime. When you first start the questions are easy, but as you progress the questions will get more difficult.
